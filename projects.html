                I've always been interested in a wide variety of subjects, eager to pursue an abundance of projects.  
                My passion for many different things is fueled by my curiosity, 
                a thirst to learn and absorb knowledge regarding anything that fascinates me.  
                Previous dominated by art, music, and writing, recently this curiousity has turned to technology.  
                Creeping away from pencils, notepads, pianos, and flutes, 
                my focus started to shift primarily towards the intriguing realm of tech.  
                I would dream up complex ideas, yet lacked the knowledge to execute them, 
                unable to bring them into reality.<br>

                This is where All Star Code comes in.<br>

            <p class="pageText">
                All Star Code, a summer intensive for young students of color, 
                has given me the tools I needed to finally bring my dreams into fruition.  
                After just 6 weeks of classes, I now feel confident in my abilities 
                to get started on projects that felt too out of reach prior to the program, 
                inspired to pursue a journey into the world of tech.
