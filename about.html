            Who am I?<br></p>
            <p class="pageText">There are many ways to define who I am.  
                But due to my interest in learning new perspectives, the ability to view the world 
                through different lenses, I tend to speak about who I am in terms of 
                what exactly shapes my own unique perspective.<br></p>
            <p class="pageText">My family is an essential aspect of my life.  
                They give me culture, opportunity, home.  They give me both guidance and room to grow, 
                as well as ways to explore my own identity.  Part of my perspective comes from my composition: 
                my mother is an immigrant from Korea and my father belongs to many races, primarily Black.  
                My dad always tells me that I’m not of two halves, but of two wholes.  
                Sometimes it’s tough to feel a bit out of place at times, 
                feeling a bit too dark in a room of Koreans, eyes a bit too slim in a room of Black people.  
                But ultimately, being able to experience multiple cultures through foods, traditions, music, 
                is a blessing that I am eternally grateful for.  Besides, I know that I’m not alone; 
                I have my sisters, one older and one younger, who will always be of two wholes with me.<br></p>
