                One of the first things I ever had was football.  Even before my name was inked on my birth certificate, it was decided by my father that I would play.  I've grown up with the game, and in some aspects, the game has grown me.  When I first moved to middle school, I knew almost no one.  But through football, I made connections that persist to this day.  Whenever I interact with new people, my passion for football always seems to emerge within the very first conversations.  Sports are universal, helping humans connect through their love of the physical art, and I have my own sport to thank for easing me into new environments and helping me connect with others.<br></p>
            <p class="pageText">Donning 44 and set to play running back and linebacker, my highschool career started in 2017.  It began with a daunting start - as a freshman, I had an entire playbook to memorize, a new coaching staff to impress, and better opponents.  In my first scrimmage, there were indeed rough patches, but I started to understand my assignments, even leading a drive down the field, sealing it with the touchdown score.  As I devoted myself to proving my worth to the team and improving as a player, staying late after practices to work out and spending bus rides staring at film on my phone, I noticed evident improvement.  My freshman season culminated with a 205-yard game, helping me win All-Conference honors.  That year served as a reminder as to how sweet the fruits of labor can be, depending on how you nuture them.<br></p>
            <p class="pageText">I love football for its masterful blend of physical and mental durability.  Any minute detail could potentially determine a win or loss, prompting players to stay vigilant; one must be poised in their stance as well as their mind to excel in football.  Strategies must be conjured, muscles must be trained, determination and dedication to the game must be groomed, fostering mental and physical growth in the player.  I always strive to better myself with every practice, putting in the effort in the weight room and in the film room.  This attitude that football has cultivated in me all these years, my hunger to constantly improve, has permeated into all aspects of my life, a translation I am truly grateful for.</p>
